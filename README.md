# BYR4M'sModPack for Icarus!
Compatible with latest game update "Icarus Week Thirty One Update | Community Feedback #1".

---- DISCLAIMER ----

- Always respect that some players prefer to play vanilla and do not want to play a 'modded' experience.
- We recommend you use this modpack alone or with friends only. Please DO NO JOIN A RANDOM SESSION! as this could cause errors for everyone playing.
- Please ensure everyone in the same session are all running the same mods. This will avoid any conflicts between file changes.


---- DESCRIPTION ----

This modpack was created with the intentions of not breaking any game physics but as a 'Quality of Life Improvement.'
We have tried our best at explaning ALL changes this modpack provides with no hidden surprises.
We have also made a 'Standalone' section on our github and have segmented every single change individually, so players can pick and choose what edits they desire.


-- INVENTORY INCREASES --
- Backpack (Inventory) slots increased from 24 > 30
- Space Player Loadout slots increased from 15 > 30
- DropShip slots increased from 15 > 30
- Generator Storage/Extractor slots increased from 5 > 10


-- STACK SIZE INCREASES --
- Exotics stack increased from 20 > 30

This change balances well along with the Generator/Extractor inventory edits made in this modpack.
It allows you to be able to place an extractor, go do something else and come back in like 20-25 minutes with all the Exotics mined and safely waiting inside the inventory.. not spilling out all over the ground!

- Cooked Corn stack increased from 10 > 20

-- CRAFTING RECIPE CHANGES --
- Extractor time per ore has been decreased from 20 sec > 5 sec

Our community love most aspects of this game but spending an hour or two waiting for an Exotic vein to deplete wasn't something we could enjoy doing.
Even at 5 seconds per ore, you're still gonna need to spend 20-25 minutes until it's finished. So it's not too OP or at all game breaking. Just another quality of life improvement.


-- WORKSHOP ITEM CHANGES --
- Meta Canteen Shengong (workshop item) will now come prefilled.
- Meta Oxygen Tank Shengong (workshop item) will now come prefilled.
- Meta Bandage Shengong (workshop item) has now been replaced with a Bio Fuel Lantern, which will also come prefilled with Bio Fuel. You'll thank us later!


-- LOOT REWARD CHANGES --
- Drop chance of Fatty T-Bone from Bears has been increased from 45% > 60%
- Drop chance of Fatty T-Bone from Polar Bears has been increased from 50% > 75%
- Drop chance of Fatty T-Bone from Polar Bear Clubs has been increased from 50% > 60%
- Added the drop chance of Fatty T-Bones from Bear Clubs at the rate of 60% to match that of Polar Bear Clubs
- The amount of Exotics rewarded for completing all 3 waves of hordes has been increased to the following

MinRandomStackCount 30 > 50
MaxRandomStackCount 45 > 100

(This means that you should now get between 50-100 Exotics per wave, all 3 waves would net you between 150-300 Exotics.)


-- TALENT TREE CHANGES --
- The "Waste Not" talent has been replaced with our "Gimme Gimme" talent!

"Higher tier metals have a small chance to yield Exotics!"
We first had 3 talent tree points, 1%, 2% and 3% but found that 2 or 3% was too often for our liking. We didn't want to make it easy to source Exotics but instead a pleasant surprise here and there..
Therefore we removed 2 of the talent points and left just one to unlock and gain a 1% chance to yield Exotics.
This change has been tested quite a lot and we assure you it's not game breaking. 
We would gain an extra 10-15 Exotics per mission. We usually mine around 4-5 caves max and remember, this chance is only on higher tier metals. Not any of the Tier 1.

(In addition to this talent tree change, we have also included the following changes as it relies on the same mechanics
Instead of the chance of stone when mining (if you have the "Gimme Gimee" talent you'll now have a chance of yielding slightly more of the same metal/stone/oxite/sulfur/coal you are mining. 
This is quite a nice addition as it only slightly boosts your ore/stone count.)


-- ORE DEPOSITS/METALS CHANGES --
- Gold has now been made a Tier 2 Metal (needing a steel pickaxe or better)

Our reasoning behind this change was because 'most' of the recipes requiring gold were Tier 2 or higher. So it just felt like the right thing to do. Nonetheless, your feedback is always welcomed.


-- DAMAGE MULTIPLIERS --
- The crossbow damage multiplier has been increased and balanced between the Recurve_Bow (x1.5) and the Compound_Bow (x2.0)

The damage multiplier is now the equivilent to the Meta_Bow_Shengong at x1.75
Again, our aim isn't to make the game too easy, it's just quality of life adjustments that in our opinion makes the game more enjoyable. That's all.


-- DEBUFF CHANGES --
- The debuffs "Underground" and "Pneumonia" have been disabled in caves. 
- This is really just a preference of ours as we spend most our time down in those pesky caves!


-- G TOOL QUICKSLOT CHANGES --
- Added the ability to carry the following tools in your inventory as usual. They're no longer restricted to the G Tool Quickslot.

Extractors: Biofuel Extractor, Electric Extractor & Meta Extractor

Radars: Biofuel Radar, Electric Radar & Meta Radar

No more deciding between the two. Now you can carry your mission items, extractors and even radars.. all at the same time!


-- OUTPOST CHANGES --
- XP Nerf has been removed. Now gain the usual amount of XP you would expect to gain in any other mission. You're welcome.

We used to have a few more changes when it came to OUTPOSTs but since the devs have added a vanilla OLYMPUS map, we have decided to revert a few changes and only make changes to the XP nerf instead.

(If you STILL wanna be able to explore STYX full map whilst in an OUTPOST. You'll find a STYXFULLMAP_P.pak file in the standalone section.)
